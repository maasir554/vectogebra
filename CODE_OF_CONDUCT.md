# about this project

this is my first object-oriented project.
as i learnt object-oriented programming, for the first time.

I made this project to learn how to use python to define classes and make modules out of it.
as I was alredy aware of functions, I thought it would be a good idea to make a module out of it.
and I liked vectors in physics and mathematics.
thats why I made a vector library.
